####Use Case Name: Return Allergy Details

**Level:**                     User Level Goal

**Primary Actors:**            Doctor/ Physician/ Clinician 

**Stakeholders:**              Patient Charting User

**Purpose:**                   TThe main intent of this use case is to return details of the particular allergy.

**Pre Condition:**             Doctor/ Physician/ Clinician must be identified and authenticated.  

**Post Condition:**            Allergy details returned successfully.  

**Frequency of Occurrence:**   High

**Priority:**                  High
__________________________________________________________
**Main Success Scenario: (Return Allergy Details)**

1.	Physician will select allergy from the list and will request for its details.
2.	System will display the identity of the user who added, modified, inactivated or removed items from the allergy and adverse reaction list, including attributes of the changed items along with its date and time.

This list can be utilised as a source of up-to-date adverse reaction data for exchange or as the basis for decision support. 

This list can be comprised of three types of archetype:
- statements about the positive use of medications are recorded using the EVALUATION.adverse_reaction archetype; OR
- a statement about the positive exclusion of medication use can be recorded using the specific EVALUATION.exclusion-adverse_reaction archetype - for example: \"No known adverse reactions\"; OR
- a statement about no information being available - neither a positive and known presence of an adverse reaction nor a positive exclusion - can be recorded using the EVALUATION.absence archetype.

In order for this list to be accurate and safe to use as the basis for decision support activities and for exchange, this list should ideally be curated by a clinician responsible for the health record, rather than managed automatically by the clinical system through business rules alone.">

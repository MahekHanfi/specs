#####Use Case ID: UC-PCS15
####Use Case Name: Add New Allergy

**Level:**                     User Level Goal

**Primary Actors:**            Doctor/ Physician/ Clinician 

**Stakeholders:**              Patient Charting User

**Purpose:**                   The main intent of this use case is to add new allergy in the list.

**Pre Condition:**             Doctor/ Physician/ Clinician must be identified and authenticated.  

**Post Condition:**            New allergy added successfully without any conflicts.

**Frequency of Occurrence:**   High

**Priority:**                  High
__________________________________________________________
**Main Success Scenario: (Add New Allergy)**

1.	Physician selects the new allergy option for the particular patient.
2.	Physician will perform following actions:
    * She/he will select the coded allergy from the list 
    * She/he will specify source, type and severity of allergy.
3.	System performs following actions;
    * It will validate the information.
    * It will perform interaction checking of new allergy with allergy and medication list.
    * It will associate medication with allergy if some interaction found.
4.	Physician will add remarks (if any) and save the new allergy.
5.	System will perform following actions:
    * It will capture, as discrete data, the user ID and date/time stamp.
    * It will set allergy status to active.

This list can be utilised as a source of up-to-date adverse reaction data for exchange or as the basis for decision support. 

This list can be comprised of three types of archetype:
- statements about the positive use of medications are recorded using the EVALUATION.adverse_reaction archetype; OR
- a statement about the positive exclusion of medication use can be recorded using the specific EVALUATION.exclusion-adverse_reaction archetype - for example: \"No known adverse reactions\"; OR
- a statement about no information being available - neither a positive and known presence of an adverse reaction nor a positive exclusion - can be recorded using the EVALUATION.absence archetype.

In order for this list to be accurate and safe to use as the basis for decision support activities and for exchange, this list should ideally be curated by a clinician responsible for the health record, rather than managed automatically by the clinical system through business rules alone.">

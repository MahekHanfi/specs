The entire allergy history, including reaction, for any allergen is viewable. The list(s) includes all reactions including those that are classifiable as a true allergy, intolerance, side effect or other adverse reaction to drug, dietary or environmental triggers. Notations indicating whether item is patient reported and/or provider verified are maintained.

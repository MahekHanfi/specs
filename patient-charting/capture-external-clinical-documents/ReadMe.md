####Description
--------------
External sources are those outside the EHR system, including clinical, administrative, and financial information systems, other EHR systems, PHR systems, and data received through health information exchange networks. Mechanisms for incorporating external clinical data and documentation (including identification of source) such as image documents and other clinically relevant data are available. Data incorporated through these mechanisms is presented alongside locally captured documentation and notes wherever appropriate.

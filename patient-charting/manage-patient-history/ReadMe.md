####Description
--------------
The history of the current illness and patient historical data related to previous medical diagnoses, surgeries and other procedures performed on the patient, and relevant health conditions of family members is captured through such methods as patient reporting (for example interview, medical alert band) or electronic or non-electronic historical data. This data may take the form of a pertinent positive such as: "The patient/family member has had..." or a pertinent negative such as "The patient/family member has not had..." When first seen by a health care provider, patients typically bring with them clinical information from past encounters. This and similar information is captured and presented alongside locally captured documentation and notes wherever appropriate.

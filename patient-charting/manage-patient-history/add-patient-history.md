#####Use Case ID: UC-PCS21
####Use Case Name: Add Patient History

**Level:**                     User Level Goal

**Primary Actors:**            Doctor/ Physician/ Clinician 

**Stakeholders:**              Patient Charting User

**Purpose:**                   The main intent of this use case is to add history of the patient.

**Pre Condition:**             Doctor/ Physician/ Clinician must be identified and authenticated.  

**Post Condition:**            The patient history added successfully.

**Frequency of Occurrence:**   High

**Priority:**                  High
__________________________________________________________
**Main Success Scenario: (Add Patient History)**

1.	Physician selects the new patient history option for the particular patient.
2.	Physician will add smoking status, alcohol status and intrinsic patient history.
3.	Physician will save the history.
4.	System will store history in coded form.

__________________________________________________________
**Alternate Flows** 

**Alt-1:**

1.	Physician will specify the location to collect history.
2.	System will perform following actions:
    * It will collect history from specified sources.
    * It will validate history.
    * It will store history in coded form.

**Sub-Flow**
1.	Specified source is not accessible.
2.	Request cannot be processed.

Use to incorporate the narrative descriptions of clinical history within existing or legacy clinical systems into an archetyped format, using the 'Story' data element.

Use to record a simple narrative and/or as a container archetype - to provide a common, queryable ENTRY archetype framework which can be extended by the inclusion of additional, specific and detailed CLUSTER archetypes, each of which will describe the various aspects of the clinical history. Examples of history-related CLUSTER archetypes include CLUSTER.symptom or CLUSTER.health_event.">

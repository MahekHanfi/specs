####Description
--------------
Medication lists are managed over time, whether over the course of a visit or stay, or the lifetime of a patient. All pertinent dates, including medication start, modification, and end dates are stored. The entire medication history for any medication, including alternative supplements and herbal medications, is viewable. Medication lists are not limited to medication orders recorded by providers, but may include, for example, pharmacy dispense/supply records, patient-reported medications and additional information such as age specific dosage.

**Frequency of Occurrence:**   High

**Priority:**                  High
__________________________________________________________
**Main Success Scenario: (Create Medication Order)**

1.	Physician selects the new medication order option and selects MRNO (or any other identification criteria) from the list.
2.	System shows the relevant data including weight of the patient, allergies and history.
3.	Physician specifies symptoms, signs, and investigations.
4.	System will perform the following action:  
  * It will show the list of medication,  
  * It will calculate the dosage of medication based on body mass index, age or defined medication protocols.
5.	Physician selects the medication from the specified list and specifies the frequency and route of medication.
6.	System performs following actions:  
  * validate information,  
  * Investigate for any drug or allergy interactions.
7.	Physician will save the medication order.
8.	System will perform following actions:  
  * It will record the time stamp of ordered medication,  
  * It will set medication status to active,  
  * It will send order to pharmacy along with order ID.

__________________________________________________________
**Alternate Flows** 

**Alt-1: If medication not exist in list**

1.	Physician will search medication by its name, code or brand name.
2.	System will show the list of medications.
3.	Physician will select required medication
4.	The steps 6 to 8 in main scenario of events are then executed.

**Alt-2: Verbal Order**

1.	Repeat step 1 and 2 from the main scenario.
2.	Physician prescribes medication verbally and system records it.
3.	System identifies medication keywords out of recorded order.
4.	Physician performs verification read back.
5.	The steps 6 to 8 in main scenario of events are then executed.

**Alt-3: Co-Signature Configuration**

1.	Repeat step 1 to 6 from the main scenario.
2.	Physician configures the medication order for verification from another physician.
3.	System notifies the physician who has to co-sign the order.
4.	Physician verifies and signs the medication order.
5.	System responds back to initiating physician.
6.	The step 7 and 8 in main scenario of events are then executed.

**Alt-4: Interaction Checking**

1.	Repeat step 1 to 6 from the main scenario.
2.	Physician review the system response of interaction checking and take actions as: 
  * In case any drug or allergy interaction reveals, it sort some other alternate medication and proceed with normal order flow if find no drug to drug or drug to allergy interaction, 
  * In case absence of any drug to drug or drug to allergy interaction, the physician proceeds with normal flow of medication order, 
  * System will set the medication status to active.
3.	The step 7 and 8 in main scenario of events are then executed.

			purpose = <"*To record information about any harmful, desirable or unexpected reaction to a substance or agent, including:
- immune mediated reactions Types I-IV (including true allergic reactions and hypersensitivities), and 
- non-immune mediated reactions (including pseudoallergic reactions, side effects, intolerances, drug toxicities (eg Gentamicin), drug-drug interactions, food-drug interactions, drug-disease interactions and idiosyncratic reactions).

To record information about previous exposures to a substance, allowing a persisting and evolving summary of adverse reaction events to build up over time.

To record additional information that will support and inform a clinical assessment of the propensity of an individual to experience an adverse reaction if exposed to a specific substance, class of substance or agent in the future.(en)">
			use = <"*Use to record all information about the presence of adverse reaction/s (including an allergic reaction/s)  to a substance to support direct clinical care of an individual; as part of a managed Adverse Reaction list; to enable safe exchange of information about adverse reactions; and to assist computerised knowledge-based activities such as clinical decision support and alerts.

Use to provide a single place within the health record to record a range of clinical statements about adverse reactions, including:  
-  record cumulative information about each exposure to a known substance, class of substance or agent; and 
-  record a clinician's opinion that administration of, or exposure to, a substance or agent is absolutely contraindicated.

This archetype has been designed to allow recording of information about a more generic substance, class of substance or agent, and then allow more specific details to be recorded including identification of the specific substance on a per exposure basis, including links to other parts of the health record where further details may be located. Note:  it is possible on second or subsequent exposures to a previously identified substance for a reaction not to occur and this archetype allows for these events to be closely linked in a way that will assist in determining if the adverse reaction has been incorrectly identified.

Design of this archetype has been deliberatly focused on identifying a pragmatic, core data set that will be suitable for most common use clinical scenarios but permits extension of the model when additional detail is required through incorporation of additional archetypes in the 'Additional Reaction Detail', 'Additional Exposure Detail', and 'Reporting Details' slots. Examples of clinical situations where the extension will be required are for a detailed immunology assessment, for reporting to regulatory bodies or clinical trial use.

A data element for Substance Category has not been modelled as this should be able to be derived from any coded entry for Substance/Agent and be used in decision support activities. A coded Category is not adequate to support decision support if Substance/Agent is only entered via free text.

The act of recording an adverse reaction in the health record implies there is a potential hazard for the individual if they are exposed to the same substance/agent in the future - a relative contraindication. If a clinician considers that it is not safe for the individual to be deliberately re-exposed to the substance/agent again, for example, following a manifestation of anaphylaxis, the 'Absolute contraindication' data flag should be recorded as âTrueâ. Note: Conversely, a statement about âSeverityâ of propensity (with possible values such as Mild, Moderate and Severe) has deliberately not been modelled explicitly. Predicting or estimating the grade of possible severity of a future reaction is not safe to record and persist in data, except where it is absolutely clear that the risk of deliberate re-exposure is unacceptable and highly likely to cause significant harm, such as a previous manifestation of anaphylaxis, and in this case the âAbsolute contraindicationâ data flag should be used. 

Valuable first-level information that could be presented to the clinician when they need to assess propensity for future reactions are:
- statements about previous clinical manifestations following exposure,
- source of the information/reporter, and
- a flag for absolute contra-indication. 
Second-level information can be drawn from each exposure event and links to additional detailed information such as history, examination and diagnoses stored elsewhere in the record, if it is available.

A formal Adverse Reaction Report to regulatory bodies is a document that will contain a broad range of information in addition to the specific details of the adverse reaction. The report will be comprised of this Adverse Reaction archetype plus a variable number of others - for example, demographics, weight, medication and problem/diagnosis.(en)">

			use = <"For recording instructions to dispense, administer or use a medicine, vaccine or other therapeutic good. This medication instruction can be used in many circumstances including: a record in a progress note; an item in a medication list, prescription  or drug chart (to be dispensed and/or administered); or in a summary document such as discharge summary or a referral for care. The instruction may be complex and involve more than one activity, such as in the case of a reducing dose of Predisolone, or multiple medications as components of the same order.  This would include a written order by a physician, dentist, nurse practitioner, or other designated health professional for a medication to be dispensed and administered to a patient.

This instruction will generally apply to things that can be prescribed or are available 'over the counter'.

Use for orders for vaccinations or other therapeutic goods. These may be presented differently in different applications but require the same structure.
Use for the consistent representation of an item in a medication list comprising the medicines that a clinicians collectively expect the individual to be taking.
The information recorded may separate dose, route and timing to achieve a computable and sharable specification but also allows for narrative instructions for orders like 'Frusemide 40mg two tablets in the morning and one at lunch' to ensure compatibility with existing systems. To achieve a structure statement for such compound orders, two items are required: 'Frusemide 40mg two tablets in the morning' and 'Frusemide 40mg one tablet at lunch'. The instruction will usually include information about the timing and dose  (which may be structured) and in some settings will include the route of administration. The amount of the medicines will usually be given in terms of a number and a dose unit but may be a textural statement to ensure compatibility with existing systems and also coverage of all scenarios.
Use to represent a prescription item for a medicine, vaccine or other therapeutic good within a document such as an electronic prescription (see COMPOSITION.prescription) or a medication chart.
The content is potentially complex. Where the content is re-usable in other contexts, especially the paired ACTION.medication archetype (for recording dispensing, administration etc) the content has been specified in re-useable CLUSTER archetypes. For example: CLUSTER.amount and CLUSTER.amount-range contain the detail about Medication dose; CLUSTER.timing contains detail about structured dose timing; CLUSTER.medication_administration contains structure around administration for both the order and the action; and CLUSTER.chemical_description described the specific ingredients within a medicine. All of these archetypes together are required to make up the total maximal dataset for a re-useable medication instruction.">
